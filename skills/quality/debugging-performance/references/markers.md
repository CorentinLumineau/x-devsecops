# Debugging Introspection Markers

> Visual indicators for transparent problem-solving

## Marker Reference

### 🤔 Analyzing
**When**: Gathering information, parsing errors, reviewing context
```
🤔 Analyzing error context...
   Error: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
   Stack trace: userService.ts:45
   Recent changes: Email validation added 2 days ago
```

### 🎯 Hypothesis
**When**: Forming root cause theory, selecting strategy
```
🎯 Root cause hypothesis...
   H1: Validation returns undefined instead of user (85%)
   H2: Database connection timeout (10%)
   H3: Missing error handling (5%)
   Selected: H1 - Validation logic error
```

### ⚡ Testing
**When**: Reproducing issue, applying fixes, executing tests
```
⚡ Testing hypothesis...
   Reproduced: Validation with invalid email returns undefined
   Expected: Should throw validation error
   Root cause confirmed: emailValidator.ts:23
```

### 📊 Data
**When**: Measuring impact, collecting metrics, assessing severity
```
📊 Impact assessment...
   Affected: All user creation endpoints
   User impact: Cannot create accounts
   Severity: High (blocks signup)
```

### 💡 Insight
**When**: Pattern recognition, resolution, lessons learned
```
💡 Resolution...
   1. Update validator to throw ValidationError
   2. Add error handling in service
   3. Add regression test for edge cases
   Validated: All creation flows work ✅
```

## Workflow Examples

### Quick Fix (Tier 1)
```
⚡ Quick fix...
   Error: ReferenceError: user is undefined
   File: auth.test.ts:23
   Fix: Add missing variable declaration
✅ Tests passing
```

### Debug Session (Tier 2)
```
🤔 Analyzing API issue...
🎯 Hypothesis: Race condition in cache
⚡ Testing: Confirmed cache key collision
📊 Fix applied and validated ✅
```

### Troubleshooting (Tier 3)
```
🤔 Context gathering (workflow-gate)...
🎯 Systematic investigation (Sequential MCP)...
⚡ Debug instrumentation added...
📊 Data collection complete...
💡 Root cause: Processing exceeds timeout
   Solution: Async queue with progress callbacks
```

## Integration with Sequential MCP

For complex multi-component analysis:
```
🤔 Starting Sequential Thinking...
   Thought 1/5: Analyzing upload pipeline
   Thought 2/5: Identifying timeout source
   Thought 3/5: Profiling processing time
   Thought 4/5: Evaluating solutions
   Thought 5/5: Recommending async approach
🎯 Recommendation: Move to async queue
```
